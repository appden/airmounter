AirMounter
==========

This is an AppleScript I've used for a long time to automatically mount my AirDisk volumes when I'm on my home network.  I wrote it to learn about AppleScripts, and there is nothing about it that I am proud of.

Installation
------------

Open it in AppleScript Editor, and save a compiled .app file in your Applications folder.
